NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD,"GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2021 international $)","This indicator provides values for gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in constant international dollars, converted by purchasing power parities (PPPs). PPPs account for the different price levels across countries and thus PPP-based comparisons of economic output are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants than exchange-rate based comparisons. 

Gross domestic product is the total income earned through the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production approach. The core indicator has been divided by the general population to achieve a per capita estimate. This indicator is expressed in constant prices, meaning the series has been adjusted to account for price changes over time. The reference year for this adjustment is 2021. The PPP conversion factor is a currency conversion factor and a spatial price deflator. PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries, thereby allowing volume or output comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components.","International Comparison Program (ICP), World Bank (WB), uri: https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp/data, note: This information is for ICP’s PPPs utilized in WDI, publisher: International Comparison Program (ICP), date accessed: May 30, 2024, date published: May 30, 2024;
